# Proposal for Adventure | First Steps
These were written immediately inspired by the "What If's" in the [What If's](what-ifs.md) document

I'm down if you're down!

* UI is developed entirely and only in [threejs](https://threejs.org/)
* A "world sphere" that rotates with arrow keys
* Camera perspective is isometric and close to the world sphere surface, down and tilted up so a sliver of the horizon always visible at the top edge of the viewport
* World sphere diameter increases in size with population size
* User "domain" placed on surface (each has one, analog to "profile")
* "In" navigation moves in from world sphere scope to hovered/selected user domain
* "Domain" is a users "room" (analog to a profile, but maybe it's not infinite and can get "messy")
* "Out" navigation shifts perspective back out to the world sphere scope

## Hmm...
Maybe justification for [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) cost

Maybe stuff like this is WAY easier today with the new models than we might expect
